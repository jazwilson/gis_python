As the instructors of the Geo-Python course, we think we've found a better way to assess the individual happiness of people in Finland (particularly those taking this course!), and we're going to test our idea with you. In five easy steps (or problems) we'll be able to reveal your happiness based on two of life's most important happiness factors: Ice cream and sleep!"
